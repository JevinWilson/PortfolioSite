												Using the dataset we can see that "larger" vehicles dominate the most popular
												vehicle segment manufactured in 2025 with the top 5 being medium sized SUVs, larger
												sized SUVs, full sized luxury, passenger vans, and smaller sized SUVs.
												After the larger vehicles there is a noticable drop of almost 30% to the
												rest of the vehicle segments. But this doesn't tell the whole story of the
												most popular vehicles segments due to not having sales data.

												<h3>How do different drivetrains compare in real life efficiency?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												It is not surprising for FWD to be the most efficienct due to FWD having a 
												history of being a cheaper consumer option with cheaper and lighter materials
												used. You would think that they would have the most range due to being the
												most efficienct but they have the lowest avg battery capacity. I think it
												is due to my point earlier that FWD vehicles are mainly mostly known to be 
												consumer affordable options and manufactures cheap out on the battery for 
												them. It is also no surprise to see FWD vehicles being the worse on all 
												performance metrics due to its inferior weight transfer, handling/cornering,
												balance, etc, automaker don't tend to make FWD vehicles with performance
												in mind.

												<h3>Do bigger batteries mean less effective power units?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												As the battery size increases the avgerage efficiency gets worse as well as 
												the range. So yes, according to our dataset a bigger battery means less
												efficiency. I wouldn't say a less effective power unit because there are 
												other metrics and factors not available in the dataset that would be needed. 
												One of the main and obvious reason I can think of why this is, is simply 
												because manufactures try to offset the lower efficiency with a larger 
												battery capacity.
